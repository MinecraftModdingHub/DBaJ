Don't Be a Jerk II
====

The "Don't Be a Jerk 2" or "DBaJ2" non-commercial care-free license is designed for use licensing computer programming code and compiled binaries. 

Not that it can't be used for anything else, but that's what it was designed for. 

Feel free to fork, tweak, and re-use some or all of the license for your own purposes. At some point in time, I'll probably make it non-specific, so you won't have to fork it if you want to use it.

Specifically, it's intended to be used to license Minecraft mods but may also apply to other codes, compiled binaries and/or software when needed.

Read the license. You might just like it.

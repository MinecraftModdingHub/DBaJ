##DBaJ2 - Don't Be a Jerk 2

This computer software code ("the code") is ©2014 jakimfett ("the author") all rights reserved, and is licensed for use and redistribution under the “Don’t Be a Jerk 

II” non-commercial care-free license.
Based off the original DBAJ ("Don't Be a Jerk") license from jakimfett, improvements made by Gustavo6046.

#Scope

This means that you’re free to pretty much do what you like with the the code (source) or compiled binaries (jar/zip/class files), including but not limited to:

 ####Download code or compiled binaries for personal use
  #####Put the code or compiled binaries into your modpack
  #####Fork the repository on github
  #####Compile the code
 ####Modify the code to:
  #####fix bugs
  #####add features
  #####fit better with your modpack
  #####remove a problematic item
  #####replace all item icons with cat pictures, because cats are...
  #####Use portions of the code as examples in a presentation
  #####Record portions of gameplay for display on YouTube or other video/media sites

The above usage is granted to you as long as this license remains intact for all original or derived code. Please include a copy of this license with the code, or provide a link to this document, just to make sure everyone's as cool as you.

#Ownership

This licence specifically prohibits you from claiming the the code or compiled binaries are yours without permission from the previous author(s).

#Non-Commercial Status

You are expressly prohibited from making or trying to make money from the code, derivatives of the code, compiled portions of the code, etc etc.

This license specifically prohibits you from using AdF.ly or AdF.ly clones (any "click past an ad before you can download" service) to make money or attempt to make money for clicks or downloads.

Specific exceptions to the non-commercial nature of this license are granted to any derivitive works of art. Here's some specific exemptions:
If you make a cool tee-shirt design based off the code and want to sell that, it's completely ok.
Want to use the the code or compiled binaries as part of a charity event? Go ahead.
Make money from Let's Play videos or other "commentary" type uses, eg reviews or how-to videos/tutorials? No problem.

You are expressly prohibited from (re)distributing this software/code in illegal sites, with different cost from original (i.e. free or cheaper than original copies' price), in Vietnam-hosted distributing sites, sites that don't fit in the international copyright laws (including but not limited to Vietnamita sites), and 
redistributing it claiming it is a different version/build/etc from the actual file (e.g. marking the code as build 1.7.10 instead of the actual file's 1.6.8).
You are expressively free to put the code or software in any modpack or pack of softwares, and even monetize it, as long as the author give permission. Without
permission, you may only put that code or software in modpacks or resource packs or etc without monetizing it in ad sites (like adf.ly) or giving it a explicit price. 

It is okay if any part of the monetization's revenue is destinated to the author as well (unless an non-original price is applied to the code/software itself, not including ad sites, which makes tons of downloads for few cents); if you're going to give the author less than 20% of the revenue gained by selling the pack(s) or monetizing them in ad sites or etc, it will not apply, however, unless with permission.

Ultimately, your work is your own. _This_ license is designed to protect against jerks trying to make money off someone else's work (with some few exceptions) and, specially, claiming that work as their own, which is extremely disencouraging for the author _himself_. Any exemptions not listed here require permission from the code author.

#Damages

This license prohibits any attempt to hold the author liable for damages caused by usage of the the code or compiled binaries. Bugs happen, even with the safest codes, so don't complain if something goes wrong, as the author may have noticed it and will fix it later. Instead of complaining and holding the author liable, tell that issue to the author gently so he can fix it with no problem.
######He will do what the _*----*_ he needs to fix them, hopefully.

#Reserved Rights

I reserve the right to change this license at any time, although chances are I won't, because legalese annoys me.

#Conclusion
Ultimately, don't be a jerk, play nice, be polite, and you'll be fine. Especially following these **huge** *_tons_* of lines of rules.
